# Description:
Automated the provisioning and management of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Implemented a scalable and reliable architecture by defining resources such as VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS instances in Terraform configuration files. This project ensured consistent and repeatable environments across development, testing, and production, enhanced security through IAM roles and policies, and facilitated scalability with autoscaling groups and load balancers. The approach provided significant improvements in automation, version control, and infrastructure consistency.
